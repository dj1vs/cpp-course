If you try to mimic this build system by hand, youâ€™ll discover that

	Some users may expect features you do not use.

	(Think portable shell scripts/portable Makefiles, on systems you may

	' Tools to create the GNU Build System from simple instructions.
	' A central place where fixes and improvements are made.
